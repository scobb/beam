## Next up
ALL non-blocked stories complete. BEAM-216 and BEAM-219 remain blocked (in blocked-stories.json).
→ Enter self-generation mode: audit deployed product, review progress.txt, write 5-10 new stories

## Active issues
- BEAM-216 (auto-blocked): /for/sveltekit, /for/vue, /for/nuxt — blocked after 3 consecutive failures
- BEAM-219 (blocked): HN Show HN, BetaList, Indie Hackers, AlternativeTo — manual auth required. Steve emailed.
- Staging DNS does not resolve — run smoke tests locally or against prod only
- Prod CF route registration errors on deploy (pre-existing — routes exist, worker upload succeeds)
- Prod signup rate limit (10/hour/IP) gets exhausted from running multiple smoke runs in same session — space out prod test runs

## Key decisions this session
- Changelog is hardcoded in src/routes/changelog.ts (not DB-driven) — add entries directly to CHANGELOG array
- New date groups go at TOP of array (most recent first)
- Resend sender must use keylightdigital.dev (not .com)
- PRD key is userStories (not stories)
